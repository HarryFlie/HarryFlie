# Hi, I'm Haris Khan 👋

🎓 Master's Researcher in Engineering & Applied Technology  
📍 National Taipei University of Technology (Taipei Tech), Taiwan 

### 🚀 Robotics Researcher | Control Systems Engineer

I bridge the gap between **advanced control theory** and **practical autonomous systems**. My focus is on developing robust flight control algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that maintain stability even under harsh environmental conditions.

Whether deriving Lyapunov stability proofs or designing Simulink models, I am passionate about making autonomous systems reliable and precise.

### 🔭 Current Research & Development
I am currently conducting a comparative analysis of **Linear vs. Nonlinear Control Strategies** for Quadcopters.

* **The Problem:** Standard drone controllers fail under high wind gusts or when payload mass changes unexpectedly.
* **My Solution:** Implementing and stress-testing three distinct architectures:
    * **Geometric Control:** For aggressive maneuvering on SE(3).
    * **Sliding Mode Control (SMC):** For robustness against parametric uncertainty.
    * **PD Control:** As a baseline for performance benchmarking.
* **Key Scenarios:** Tracking complex trajectories (Lemniscate & Circular) under simulated wind disturbance.
